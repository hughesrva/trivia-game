# trivia-game

This is a simple trivia game with questions based on Pokemon.

The questions are multiple choice, and clicking on a choice will take you to a screen that lets you know if your answer was correct. 

You have 15 seconds per question, and the game will automatically proceed to the next question from the results screen after 3 seconds.
